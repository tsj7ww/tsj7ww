# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Trevor

### About Me

I'm a passionate analyst who loves modeling systems and behaviors with code. I currently work in strategy & analytics at a bank, and studied economics at UVA with lots of coursework in psychology, statistics, and math. I also enjoy learning about technology and computer science in my free time. Check out my work portfolio [here](https://www.github.com/tsj7ww/portfolio#readme).
