## About Me

ðŸ‘‹ I'm a passionate analyst who loves modeling systems and behaviors through code. I currently work in strategy & analytics at a bank, with previous experience as a data analyst in operations and marketing. I studied economics at UVA and concentrated in both industrial organization and public policy, with lots of coursework in psychology, statistics, and math. I also enjoy learning about technology and computer science in my free time.
