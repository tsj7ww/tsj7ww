# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Trevor

<!-- ### About Me -->

I'm a passionate analyst who loves modeling systems and behaviors with code. I currently work in strategy & analytics at a bank, and studied economics at UVA with additional coursework in statistics, math, and psychology. I also enjoy learning about technology and computer science in my free time. Check out my work portfolio [here](https://www.github.com/tsj7ww/portfolio#readme).
